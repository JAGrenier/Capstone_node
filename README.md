# Socially Accessible Denver (Back End) 
Socially Accessible Denver is a full-stack web application designed for users with disabilities to post and read reviews of restaurants, bars, and other social locations in Denver. I was inspired to create this application from my time working in adaptive cycling. After spending all day out riding, the groups I worked with would want a place to go out and enjoy a meal together. Finding a restaurant or bar that could accommodate multiple individuals with disabilities proved to be challenging. This application would help with this by giving a place for individuals with disabilities to share their experiences.

## Features

## Challenges
With the target audience of this application, accessibility was an important goal. I faced some challenges with implementing an embedded map and meeting accessibility standards. To help me with this, I used the WAVE accessibility evaluation tool throughout the process. This tool helped me make smart choices about contrast, forms, and buttons. 

## Future Implementation
* An admin login to allow for deleting and updating reviews as needed and track traffic 
* Further accessibility testing including manual checking using screen readers 
* User profile page where they can favorite a location and track the reviews they have posted
